# Problem 2: Building Castle In The Cloud

## Overview

The objective is to design a highly available, scalable, and cost-effective trading system inspired by the Binance platform. The system must handle a throughput of **500 requests per second** with a **p99 response time of less than 100ms**, ensuring resilience to failures and the ability to scale dynamically with increasing demand.

This solution adopts a cloud-native architecture using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as the cloud provider. The design prioritizes three core features:
1. **Order Matching System**: A high-performance engine for processing buy/sell orders.
2. **Lookup System**: A service for retrieving real-time market data, such as prices and trade history.
3. **Notification System**: A mechanism for delivering real-time updates to users regarding order status and market events.

The architecture leverages **Amazon EKS** for container orchestration, enabling flexible and scalable deployment of workloads such as order matching, caching, and message queuing. **Amazon RDS (Aurora)** is used for relational data storage, while **Redis** provides low-latency caching, and **RabbitMQ/Kafka** supports reliable message queuing. To ensure **high availability**, critical components are deployed across multiple Availability Zones (Multi-AZ), with failover mechanisms such as Aurora Multi-Master for databases. Additionally, cost optimization is achieved through strategies like utilizing **Spot Instances** or **Reserved Instances** for non-critical workloads.

This design adheres to AWS best practices, balancing performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining fault tolerance and high availability.

## Scalability Plan

To ensure the trading system can efficiently handle increased user demand, a robust scalability strategy has been designed. This plan leverages **horizontal scaling** (adding resources) and **vertical scaling** (enhancing resource capacity) through AWS managed services and Kubernetes-native capabilities.

### 1. **Compute Layer Scaling (Amazon EKS)**

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):**
  - Automatically adjusts pod counts based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics (e.g., request latency).
  - Example: During peak trading hours, HPA scales pods in the Order Matching Service to manage higher loads.

- **Cluster Autoscaler:**
  - Dynamically provisions worker nodes in the EKS cluster to meet pod scheduling demands, ensuring optimal resource allocation.

- **Scaling Strategy:**
  - Use **AWS Fargate** for burstable workloads (e.g., Notification Service) to simplify EC2 management.
  - For steady-state workloads (e.g., Order Matching Service), deploy EC2-based worker nodes with reserved instances for cost efficiency.

- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG):**
  - Utilize ASGs to automatically scale EC2 instances or pods in EKS based on system load, ensuring consistent performance.

### 2. **Database Scaling (Amazon RDS Aurora)**

- **Read Replicas:**
  - Deploy up to 15 Aurora read replicas across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to distribute read traffic effectively.
  - Particularly advantageous for the Lookup Service, which frequently queries market data.

- **Database Sharding:**
  - Partition data across multiple database instances for write-heavy workloads (e.g., order matching). Sharding keys include user IDs or order types to optimize performance.

- **Backup and Recovery:**
  - Enable automated backups and point-in-time recovery to maintain data integrity during scaling operations.

### 3. **Caching Scaling (Redis)**

- **Redis Cluster Mode:**
  - Deploy Redis in cluster mode to enable horizontal scaling, automatically sharding data across nodes for high availability and performance.

- **Auto-scaling:**
  - Monitor Redis memory usage and dynamically scale instances using Kubernetes HPA.

### 4. **Message Queue Scaling (RabbitMQ/Kafka)**

- **Partitioning:**
  - Kafka supports partitioning to distribute messages across brokers for parallel processing. Increase partitions as message volume grows.

- **Consumer Groups:**
  - Scale the number of consumers in Kafka consumer groups or deploy additional RabbitMQ queues and workers to handle increased loads.

### 5. **Load Balancer Scaling (ELB)**

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):**
  - Automatically distributes requests across pods in the EKS cluster as traffic increases.
  - Use **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** for TCP/UDP traffic if required.

### 6. **Storage Scaling (Amazon S3)**

- **S3 Auto-scaling:**
  - S3 provides inherent scalability with virtually unlimited storage capacity. Lifecycle policies transition older data (e.g., logs, backups) to cost-effective storage classes like S3 Glacier.

### 7. **Monitoring and Alerts**

- **CloudWatch Metrics:**
  - Monitor key metrics (e.g., CPU/memory usage, request latency, database connections) to identify bottlenecks.
  - Configure CloudWatch alarms to trigger auto-scaling actions or notify administrators when thresholds are exceeded.

- **Custom Metrics:**
  - Leverage custom metrics (e.g., order processing time, cache hit rate) to refine scaling policies.

### Additional Considerations

- **Multi-region Deployment:**
  - To ensure high availability, deploy the system across multiple AWS regions. Use Route 53 for intelligent traffic routing based on latency or failover policies.

## Performance Evaluation and Optimization Plan

To address the current gap in providing evidence that the system architecture meets the performance requirements (`p99 response time < 100ms` and handling `500 requests per second`), the following evaluation and optimization steps are proposed:

### **1. Performance Benchmarking**
To establish a baseline for system performance, benchmarks will be conducted for critical services, including:
- **Order Matching Service**: Target latency of **20ms/request**.
- **Lookup Service**: Target latency of **30ms/request**.
- **Notification Service**: Target latency of **10ms/request**.

These benchmarks will be executed using tools such as **AWS Load Testing** or **Apache JMeter**, simulating peak workloads (e.g., 500 requests per second) to measure **p99 latency** under stress conditions. Results will validate whether the architecture meets the required thresholds.

### **2. Latency Optimization**
To achieve sub-100ms response times, the following strategies will be implemented:
- **Caching with Redis**: Frequently accessed data will be cached in **Redis** to reduce database query overhead and ensure low-latency responses.
- **Message Queuing with RabbitMQ/Kafka**: Asynchronous processing will be enabled for non-critical tasks, reducing synchronous request load and improving throughput.
- **Edge Caching with CloudFront**: A **CloudFront CDN** will be deployed to cache static and semi-dynamic content at edge locations, minimizing latency for geographically distributed users.

These optimizations will collectively enhance system responsiveness and ensure compliance with the p99 latency requirement.

### **3. Scalability Validation**
The system's ability to scale horizontally will be tested under high-load scenarios:
- **EKS Worker Nodes**: Horizontal scaling of Kubernetes worker nodes will be validated to ensure resource availability during traffic spikes.
- **RDS Aurora**: The database's scalability will be assessed to confirm its capacity to handle increased query loads without performance degradation.
- **Kubernetes HPA**: The effectiveness of the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** will be evaluated to ensure dynamic resource allocation based on real-time demand.

### **4. Continuous Improvement**
To maintain long-term performance and reliability:
- **Periodic Stress Testing**: Regular stress tests will be conducted to identify potential bottlenecks and refine system performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: **Amazon CloudWatch** will be used to monitor key metrics, detect anomalies, and trigger automated remediation actions.

Here is the revised version of your content, tailored to a senior-level test or academic report with a concise, professional tone. The focus remains on the `High Availability Strategy`, and the language has been refined for clarity and precision.

## High Availability Strategy

Ensuring high availability is critical for a trading system, where downtime or delays can lead to significant financial losses and user dissatisfaction. Below is a structured strategy to achieve fault tolerance, redundancy, and resilience across all components.

#### **1. Multi-AZ Deployment**
- **Amazon EKS**: Deploy worker nodes across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within an AWS region. Kubernetes ensures automatic rescheduling of pods on healthy nodes during failures.
- **Amazon RDS Aurora**: Utilize Aurora's native multi-AZ replication and failover mechanism to maintain database availability during AZ outages.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distribute traffic across AZs, routing requests only to healthy instances.

#### **2. Redundancy at Every Layer**
- **Compute Layer**: Run multiple replicas of each service (e.g., Order Matching, Lookup, Notification) within the EKS cluster. Use Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes for automated health monitoring.
- **Caching Layer (Redis)**: Deploy Redis in cluster mode with master-slave replication across AZs. Enable automatic failover to promote slave nodes to master during failures.
- **Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**: Ensure message durability by deploying brokers/nodes across AZs with replication enabled.

#### **3. Disaster Recovery Plan**
- **Database Backups**: Enable automated backups and point-in-time recovery for Aurora. Store backups in Amazon S3 with cross-region replication for additional redundancy.
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Use Aurora Global Database or S3 Cross-Region Replication to replicate critical data to a secondary AWS region. Deploy a standby EKS cluster in the secondary region for regional failover.
- **Failover Testing**: Conduct regular failover drills to validate the effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan and ensure minimal disruption during actual incidents.

#### **4. Chaos Engineering**
- Implement chaos engineering practices to simulate failures and test the system's resilience. Tools like AWS Fault Injection Simulator can be used to intentionally disrupt services and evaluate recovery mechanisms.

#### **5. Load Balancing and Failover**
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Continuously monitor backend instance health and route traffic only to healthy targets.
- **DNS Failover**: Use Amazon Route 53 with DNS failover policies to redirect traffic to the secondary region during regional outages.

#### **6. Monitoring and Alerts**
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alarms to detect anomalies such as high latency, increased error rates, or resource exhaustion. Trigger automated remediation actions when thresholds are breached.
- **Service Health Dashboards**: Monitor service health using Kubernetes dashboards and CloudWatch metrics. Implement custom alerts for critical components like the Order Matching Service and Redis cache.

#### **7. Graceful Degradation**
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Design fallback strategies, such as querying the database directly if Redis becomes unavailable, to ensure continued operation with higher latency.
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.

#### **8. Security and DDoS Protection**
- **AWS WAF & Shield**: Use AWS WAF to block malicious traffic and enable AWS Shield Advanced for DDoS protection.
- **IAM Policies**: Enforce least privilege access using AWS IAM policies to minimize the impact of compromised credentials.

  - Implement lifecycle policies to transition older data (e.g., logs, backups) to cheaper storage classes like **S3 Standard-IA** or **S3 Glacier**.

- **Data Compression**:
  - Compress files before uploading to S3 to reduce storage costs.

- **Cross-Region Replication**:
  - Limit replication to critical data (e.g., user accounts, order history) to minimize data transfer expenses.

### **7. Monitoring and Alerts (CloudWatch)**

- **Custom Metrics**:
  - Use custom metrics judiciously to avoid excessive CloudWatch costs.
  - Aggregate logs and metrics at the application level before sending them to CloudWatch.

- **Retention Policies**:
  - Set retention periods for logs (e.g., 30 days) and metrics (e.g., 15 months) to balance monitoring needs with cost.

### **8. General Cost Optimization Strategies**

- **AWS Cost Management Tools**:
  - Use **AWS Cost Explorer** and **AWS Budgets** to monitor spending and set alerts for unexpected cost spikes.
  - Leverage **AWS Trusted Advisor** to identify underutilized resources and optimize costs.

- **Resource Tagging**:
  - Tag all AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets) to track usage by team, project, or environment.
  - Identify and terminate unused or idle resources using tags.

- **Instance Mix**:
  - Use a combination of On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances based on workload characteristics to optimize costs.
